# EmployeeDirectory

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Description

This application uses React to display a list of 'employees' and gives you the options to sort this list by either First Name or Last Name. It will populate a list with an API from (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us) using Axios to populate the data in the table.
